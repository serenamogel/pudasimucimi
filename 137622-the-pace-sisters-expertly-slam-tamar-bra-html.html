But I don’t think she understands Jehovah. …I get that you are insecure and you are hurting, so you want to hurt someone else. …I get it that when you hear anointing, it bothers you because you don’t have it. I can get with that. But the thing about the anointing my sister has, that yoke that’s in your life, if you let her sing and pray for you long enough, it will break off and you won’t be evil. Because I know that you really don’t like being evil but because it has gotten you so much attention to this day, then therefore you live in it.”</p><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah>BACKLASH FROM FANS</h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>“When your spirit is tainted and dark and hurt and bruised, the only thing that came out of you is dark, tainted, dark and bruised things,” Leslie <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/MsLesliePace/videos/10157105906532813/>added</a>. “I knew that you needed help, but I just didn’t realize that it was really that deep that you would touch somebody that loves the Lord and was only trying to do good.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Hordes of fans have also <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BujnaxeAXh-/>called out</a> the latest “Celebrity Big Brother” <a class="ae -U" href=#>winner</a> over her remarks, labeling it “rude” and “unnecessary.”</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Screenshot of Instagram users' reactions to Tamar Braxton's comment. | Photo: Instagram/Tina Knowles</p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Michael Conrad Braxton Jr. Is a Musician – Facts about Toni Braxton's Brother</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Cafe Manager Insults Teen Employee, Unaware Her Dad Is Standing In Line – Story of the Day</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>People Share Over 40 Worst Bridezillas Stories</h2></a><h3 style=text-align:center class=ah>MORE BACKLASH FOR TAMAR</h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Tamar is no stranger to <a class="ae -U" href=#>courting controversy</a>.
