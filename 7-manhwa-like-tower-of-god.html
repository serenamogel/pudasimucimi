The tower and the people within operate under a set of rules meant to preserve the tower’s hierarchy.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Reading the manhwa, it’s easy to see why the complex action scenes and character growth have attracted so many readers. If you’ve read Tower of God, here are 7 other manhwa series to consider reading next.</p><h2 id=h-7-hardcore-leveling-warrior data-injectable=false>7. Hardcore Leveling Warrior</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Hardcore-Leveling-Warrior.png><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Hardcore Leveling Warrior has a simple premise. The protagonist Gong Won-Ho, using the in-game alias Hardcore Leveling Warrior, is the top player in the game Lucid Adventure. One day, the unthinkable happens; he gets defeated and has to make his way back up the ranks from the very bottom.</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>Part of what makes the manhwa so good is the backstory around why Won-Ho ruthlessly made his way to the top in the first place, but we won’t divulge that here.</p><h2 id=h-6-gosu data-injectable=false>6. Gosu</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gosu.png><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Gosu is a classic manhwa about Gang Yong, a strong martial artist. His master is one of the strongest martial artists in the world until the four Heavenly Kings betray him and leave him for dead.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>Gong Yong vows to get revenge against them but when he catches up to the four Kings, he finds they’ve already been killed. Now what? Gosu is a great subversion of the classic revenge plot found in so many series.</p><h2 id=h-5-omniscient-reader data-injectable=false>5. Omniscient Reader</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Omniscient-Reader.png><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Like Bam in Tower of God, Dokja starts out in Omniscient Reader (also known as Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint) as a weak “outsider” of sorts before becoming one of the strongest characters in the series.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Dokja is an ordinary office worker who only lives to read his favorite web novel. Things change suddenly when the events of the web novel become reality; as the novel’s sole reader, Dokja knows how the world will end and can change course accordingly. Who knew being a super fan of an obscure work of fiction would come in handy during the apocalypse?</p><h2 id=h-4-the-gamer data-injectable=false>4. The Gamer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Gamer.png><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>Similarly (though much lighter in tone than Omniscient Reader), The Gamer is heavily inspired by the world of RPGs. The main character Han Jihan gains the ability to view life as a video game, complete with quests EXP. points.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>At first, his life remains mostly unchanged but as he levels up, Jihan’s world becomes more fantastical. If we’re honest with ourselves, we’ve all dreamed of living in a video game, though maybe not quite like this.</p><h2 id=h-3-dungeon-reset data-injectable=false>3. Dungeon Reset</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dungeon-Reset.png><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Dungeon Reset is a unique play on common dungeon series. Protagonist Jung Daeun winds up in a dungeon alongside other characters but is the only one able to leave the dungeon.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>The dungeon, as the name implies, constantly resets and spawns new challenges. Like in Tower of God, Daeun must overcome tests to make it to the next level within the dungeon. Another draw is the many cute characters in this lighthearted dungeon manhwa — I mean, look at them!</p><h2 id=h-2-the-god-of-high-school data-injectable=false>2. The God of High School</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/God-of-High-School.png><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>The God of High School is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another popular manhwa that’s been adapted into an anime</a>. The main character Jin Mori takes part in a tournament where Korean high school students can compete to have their greatest wish granted.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true>Like Bam, Mori seems to be an ordinary kid but there’s more to this high school martial artist than meets the eye. Throughout the series, Mori meets new challengers who use unique battle styles lent to them by the gods themselves. The God of High School is a rich setting with an exciting battle system and charming characters; it’s no wonder it’s as popular as it is.</p><h2 id=h-1-kubera data-injectable=false>1. Kubera</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kubera.png><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>On her 16th birthday, Kubera loses her entire village to tragedy. She would have been lost herself, if not for a magician named Asha who becomes her reluctant savior. Alongside Asha, Kubera overcomes trials and meets exciting new characters, all while unraveling the mystery around her past.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>Kubera’s world is one where humans coexist with Sura, supernatural beings with animal-like forms. The rich world-building and well-written story makes this a must-read for any burgeoning manhwa fan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWSEbrnAp5%2BwmV2htqyxjK2msJ2iYrynecaom2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
