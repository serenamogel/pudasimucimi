Her parents taught Canady the importance of hard work and learning, which helped her to graduate from high school with honors.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Becoming a Neurosurgeon</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Alexa Canady was attending the University of Michigan, a health careers summer program for minority students sparked her interest in medicine. After graduating from college in 1971 with a major in zoology, Canady continued on to the university's medical school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Canady initially wanted to be an internist, but her plans changed when she became intrigued by neurosurgery. It was a career path that some advisers discouraged her from pursuing, and she encountered difficulties in obtaining an internship. But Canady refused to give up, and was eventually accepted as a surgical intern at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She went there after graduating, cum laude, from medical school in 1975.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When her internship ended in 1976, Canady moved to the University of Minnesota, becoming, as a resident of the university's department of neurosurgery, the first female African-American neurosurgery resident in the United States.

Though initially wary of how she would be accepted in her profession, she found that her charges and their parents appreciated her dedication to patient care. In a 1983 interview, she related that, although some people were at first surprised to see her, she suspected that they told themselves, "She's a Black woman and a neurosurgeon, so she must know what she's doing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1984, Canady was certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery, another first for a female African American.
