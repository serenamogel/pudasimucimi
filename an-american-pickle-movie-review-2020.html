Rogen is&nbsp;not technically facile enough to turn&nbsp;Herschel into a "Wow, I can't believe that was Seth Rogen" set of&nbsp;performances. He's no <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a> when it comes to accents, and he's no Daniel&nbsp;Day-Lewis&nbsp;when it comes to transforming himself into a character from another century who has no access to his emotional interior and would have no reason to think he needed any.&nbsp;</p><p>But has a firm grasp on the idea of Herschel, the feeling, the fantasy, the longing&nbsp;that he represents. He gets this man. This man is the great, great grandfather of the Jewish American subconscious, with his cap and wool clothes and mud-stained boots and huge beard and fists that lay men out cold.&nbsp;</p><p>Rogen gets Ben, too, because Rogen is&nbsp;Ben with more money, and an entertainer's instinct. Rogen makes Hollywood films and does voices for cartoons. He&nbsp;lives in a big house&nbsp;with a refrigerator, air conditioning, and a soft bed. He drives a horseless carriage.&nbsp;And he's&nbsp;great on Twitter. The film might be the self-lacerating dream of a successful writer who looked at his life and wondered what his ancestors&nbsp;would think of it. When Rogen faces Rogen, the scenes are&nbsp;charged with self-loathing, but also an awareness of self-loathing as something rooted in culture and conditioning. At the same time, though, these scenes are suffused with respect for the multigenerational&nbsp;journey that transformed&nbsp;Herschel into Ben. &nbsp;</p><p>A similar&nbsp;mix of recrimination, pride, hero worship and self-mockery is present in&nbsp;Rich's source material,&nbsp;"Sell&nbsp;Out." Rich's story&nbsp;doesn't have any of the rise-and-fall stuff that pads out and diminishes&nbsp;"An American Pickle." It's confined to Herschel's perspective and validates his withering view of modern life.&nbsp;The old world peasant describes his great-grandson's&nbsp;dependence on high technology&nbsp;in these terms:&nbsp;"The computer is a magical box that provides endless pleasure for free ... When the box stops working—or even just briefly slows down—[a man] becomes so enraged that he curses our God, the one who gave us life and brought us forth from Egypt." His great-grandson confesses that he played&nbsp;2 Live Crew at his bar mitzvah, hasn't been to synagogue in years,&nbsp;and once pretended to be a&nbsp;Christian in college to get free barbecue.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46apWaZnZq%2Fqq%2FAp2SpoZOguaZ5zKitop1dp7K3tcSwZGtoYmU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
