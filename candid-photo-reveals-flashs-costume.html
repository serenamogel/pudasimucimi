Perhaps best known to DC readers because of his work on the modern classic that was Identity Crisis – not to mention his days on Justice League of America – he’s since kept up with the characters he’s written for by visiting the sets of The Flash, Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>Seen below, Meltzer is hyping his latest novel, Escape Artist, while also enjoying a moment in between takes with actor Grant Gustin, who’s decked out in some flashy gear. By the way, this shot originates from the scribe’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> page, so be sure to head over there if you’d like to keep up with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/flash-meltzer.jpg><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Though this isn’t an official promotional picture by any means, it does provide us with an up-close look at the Flash’s new suit in direct sunlight that allows us to see the various details. Personally, I thought the previous material utilized by the costuming department looked much better, but maybe this will eventually grow on me.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>If this visual change isn’t your cup of tea, do note that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Allen will don his OG getup</a> for at least the earlier portion of the season before moving on. At the very least, that’ll satisfy those who fondly remember the series’ freshman year.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false><strong>The Flash&nbsp;</strong>returns for its fifth season on Tuesday, October 9 on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ykrc2doJ1loJ28tbuMq5yvnZGhwG6yy5qqoatdmLy0wNSmnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
