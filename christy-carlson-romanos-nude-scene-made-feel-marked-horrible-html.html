I was America’s sweetheart, morally sound in my mind. I believed in the Disney magic, I still do. And then I felt so exploited and marked and horrible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_47>She went on to explain that she did the movie because she had become “desperate.” Romano certainly isn’t the only <a href=#>former Disney star</a> to wind up exploited in one way or another. But the actor said she’s moved on, stressing that she has “made peace” with it.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_55>“I promise you I’m OK,” said Romano. “I have made peace with this. But there are some realities that come to play. The truth is that I did this movie for the money because I was desperate to feel that feeling that I had when I was making tons of money, and everything was OK.”</p><p id=par-13_9><strong>Christy Carlson Romano is now a mother of 2</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-14_22>Romano married longtime boyfriend Brendan Rooney in 2013 and has since <a href=#>given birth</a> to two children, Isabella “Izzy” Victoria, and Sophia Elizabeth.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_29>​​“I always wanted two kids and I feel so blessed to have this experience again,” the former Disney star told People in 2019 before she had her second daughter.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_15>“We are going to raise both our daughters to believe that they can do anything!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqb7IrKuyZZOWv62%2Fzqdkq6edlruwv4ynrJ2dXaiwprrEZqSanJVis6axy2akmqqbmrFutM6rqaKanJp7qcDMpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
