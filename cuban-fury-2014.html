First of all, I don’t know about you, but anything done with an English accent usually seems all the more tolerable for it. Documentary narration, cursing, someone reading the litany of side effects in a Cialis commercial. Think of how you different you would have felt about "The King’s Speech" if the monarch stuttered in Brooklynese or with a Texas twang. Of course, in that case, he probably wouldn’t be ruling England.</p><p>Second is the cast, which manages to twirl around most of the more ignominious failings of a script that clearly could have used a rewrite or two—especially considering how flimsy the female roles are—while convincing the audience that that are having a blast together.</p><p>Third, it is just plain fun to observe Frost as Bruce while he happily shimmies and shakes his way to regaining his once-renown "feet of flames." The dancing sequences are clumsily shot and edited with body doubles that are only slightly less obvious than those in "<a href=#>Flashdance</a>," but the actor’s dedication to coming close to being believable is to be applauded.</p><p>After an intro that explains Bruce’s mounting fame as a youth and his bullying-related change of heart about his salsa-king pursuits, we meet him 25 years later as a geeky industrial engineer who has never had much luck with the ladies. His idea of a big evening? Dining on a four-pack of yogurt at the kitchen table. When their new attractive American boss, Julia, arrives at the office (in the fetching form of <a href=#>Rashida Jones</a>), both he and O’Dowd’s lascivious Drew take note.</p><p>After finding out that she is a salsa aficionado herself, Bruce decides to get back in the game and seeks McShane’s Ron to help him regain his dance-floor mojo. Drew, meanwhile, relies on more deceptive means of impressing Julia, including purloining a mix tape of salsa tunes that Bruce customized for her and passing it off as his handiwork.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46crJuZnmKztr7YZmlpaWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
