Later that year, he sold his DJ equipment, after his friend Joseph “Run” Simmons acquired his own turntables and mixer, and Jam-Master Jay – who had a reputation as the best young DJ in Hollis – joined the group, Run encouraged McDaniels to rap rather than DJ.</p><p>Gradually, McDaniels came to prefer rapping to mix records, and obtained the nickname of “Easy D”. In 1981, he dropped the “Easy D” moniker in favor of “DMD”, the way he signed his work in school, and then to the shorter “D.M.C.”.</p><p>The trio released their self-titled debut album in 1984, a step that marked their success and became very successful in the hip-hop industry. The group’s success continued to grow got to its peak with their third album Raising Hell.</p><p>The album ranked No. 6 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making Run-D.M.C. the most popular hip-hop group at the time. He has thrived in the industry ever since and his most recent work includes August 13, 2018’s encore with O.A.R., playing “Walk This Way”, and his performance on “Let’s All Get the Vaccine” in 2021.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darryl-mcdaniels-depression></span><span>Darryl McDaniels Depression</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following his great success, McDaniels started drinking. He was known to drink up to eight 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor a day and was arrested twice for public intoxication and driving while intoxicated.</p><p>In 1997, McDaniels began to develop a deep depression. He began to rely heavily on prescription drugs and alcohol to ease the pain. While on tour, McDaniels noticed his voice was giving out, later being diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia.</p><p>Feeling depressed and suicidal, McDaniels heard fellow adoptee Sarah McLachlan’s song “Angel” (1997) on the radio. The song touched McDaniels so deeply that it inspired him to reassess his life and career. He credits McLachlan and her album Surfacing (on which “Angel” appeared) with saving his life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darryl-mcdaniels-songs></span><span>Darryl McDaniels Songs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>it’s tricky</li><li>it’s like that</li><li>walk this way</li><li>rock box</li><li>down with the king</li><li>sucker m.c.’s</li><li>peter piper</li><li>christmas in hollis</li><li>king of rock</li><li>the kings</li><li>just like me</li><li>praise my dj’s</li><li>proud to be black</li><li>dumb girl</li><li>beats to the rhyme</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darryl-mcdaniels-albums></span><span>Darryl McDaniels Albums</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Run-D.M.C.
