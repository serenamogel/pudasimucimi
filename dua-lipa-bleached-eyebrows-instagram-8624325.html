The video clips also included her splashing and swimming, calling back to the surf-inflected cover of the new album (which also includes an ominous shark fin). She paired the swimwear with statement jewels, including big, oversized hoops and a sculptural necklace.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Album momentsðŸŒ€I hear youâ€¦ feeling optimistic about this week," she captioned the video.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lipa has been out promoting her singles "Training Day" and "Houdini," with appearances at the BRIT Awards and more. She was an awards season regular this year, as well, because her song from&nbsp;Barbie, "Dance the Night," was nominated at several of the biggest shows, including the Golden Globes, Grammy Awards, and Critics' Choice Awards.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Samir Hussein/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a>, Lipa spoke about the new album and a key track called "Illusion," which the star called her "eureka moment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That was a song where I felt like lyrically, I got this radical optimism," she said. "I felt very strong in the moment when I was writing that song, because it was really seeing past someoneâ€™s bullshit, I guess, for lack of a better word. And understanding it for what it is and just entertaining it for the hell of it, even though you see whatâ€™s happening."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w66YZqSZpa5ursuemJyglZl6psXEm6mor6Nitq%2B%2F05qeq5mdYoV3fpNsaW4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
