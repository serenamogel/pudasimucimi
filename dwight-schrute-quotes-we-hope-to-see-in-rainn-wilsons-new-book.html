What you might not know about Wilson, is that in post Office life he’s actually turned out to be quite the acclaimed author, and is releasing his third book Soul Boom: Why We Need a Spiritual Revolution next year.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>As a matter of fact, Wilson started making strides as a writer in the midst of his nine-season tenure during the NBC hit sitcom, publishing his first book SoulPancake: Chew on Life’s Big Questions in 2010, while the seventh season of The Office was airing. He then went on to pen his memoir, The Bassoon King, in 2015.</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Both books were received extraordinarily well, hundreds of Amazon reviews of both SoulPancake and Bassoon King rate both books over the four-and-a-half star mark.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>In Wilson’s words, his new book Soul Boom will explore everything the actor and author have learned in his search for the meaning of life and the value of coming together to leave the world better than we found it. In anticipation of its release, we’ve compiled a list of eleven of the most fitting Dwight Schrute quotes Wilson could transplant into this book all about self-discovery and purpose in the world.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-1-how-would-i-describe-myself-three-words-hardworking-alpha-male-jackhammer-merciless-insatiable data-injectable=false><strong>1. “How would I describe myself?

Dwight has boiled his definition of self down to three words. Or five, in this enthusiastic description.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>2. “D.W.I.G.H.T. Determined. Worker. Intense. Good worker. Hard worker. Terrific.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh4.googleusercontent.com/E8_F3Qk7YD4Wtvwc3oVIk5kLczJd0qAVYPYbU6zqMlC3Z5cWOM9vhtiPSzuGy-tDOqjbGO4Pu9fA4B8L8uYaBE_hD3678vXkfiF7SwVN51neQzcxjwipBZAeEzN0eUloGVXWeCb0TH8JBDwCpg3wukWgwg-14oAYjvSB8qUhqHQk5j7UJ0XnWdGrJA><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>If you’re struggling with the definition of self, trying out an acronym of your first name may prove useful. Dwight would dedicate half of the descriptors to work, perhaps Rainn will have different thoughts.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>3. “Michael always says, ‘K-I-S-S: keep it simple, stupid.’ Great advice. Hurts my feelings every time.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh3.googleusercontent.com/ATW8g8v18nwMAym7Z_J3VhK1IE_qo7X9AByWYdLQ6XaiRu5fM8bk0HD8jciAKuHeVmFlLoA6XgyDoFf659pknzEl5_fTrzrWhhb9pEFvdYi4gRwdyBdwtQTIw0nPPMUGcDS9QdWylTZDBSCjLegdAYG9eN8Z-j2ioovGz9HILcsKCBqo5XyLv2gy_A><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Self-help and spirituality books often stress the need to simplify one’s life, so Dwight echoing Michael Scott’s advice seems like a good fit.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>4. “Whenever I’m about to do something, I think ‘Would an idiot do that?’ And if they would, I do not do that thing.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh6.googleusercontent.com/e5vNzwzrVJ87WwPMto809sFZ8KCPYz230wrkBOkTokBlz8CQHbj1FvsB4TrikGPU9-6kq7oi7MlKXlcalesc16MfSrbq67iRQc4_CkefdFV1u_8VZw3Blf-ZQNjq6zrxQHufosrZ_BBD_xXKX-c3KTfl7E2HnouJuNpQItGUDw3GuEwA2sM_wHqFeg><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Sticking with the theme of simplicity in navigating the obstacles which life presents, one can ask themselves one simple question.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>5. “You better learn your rules. If you don’t, you’ll be eaten in your sleep.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dwight-quote-five.png><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>Set clear boundaries for work, life, and relationships and you will succeed. Fail to do this and Dwight says you risk, no – outright states you’ll be consumed in the dead of night.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>6. “Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man’s.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh5.googleusercontent.com/3vWdAkSh3Ge8z_gb9RoiP7wFdAQnLo1NwJku1M9Z6qSQ5eYKcDAI8j_regH8Fhs2NMoSvZUnepmlMuGAOTB9OrFPacaOgfFNNRyqQxvh65i_hkFC7tX9APJEjjsBf0B_Nqxbr5BMa58Nkw7rwUBxniHtiaWn3_Gf4Ut6jrrPv4ayYbuDCQFFa6kv5w><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>In a roundabout way, Dwight is telling us to not sweat the small stuff. Not every inadvertent sleight is an attack against you. Seek to understand the point of view of others, or if it won’t continue to adversely affect you in the morning, just let it go.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>7. “There are three things you never turn your back on: bears, men you have wronged, and a dominant male turkey during mating season.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh6.googleusercontent.com/PM8xYYwEaeIBKZHUZ4i2MhLyjVlX44LcLnDcFwcchd14bi4ey0bGJ4535OAJMotmXjQPkk2SorebOzFLZB67EryVKAjJCyDzadMh3wVbGWNj1QAZFObPjzuP5s68pl_9w_x-Tt1r4oZYl3Bgbc65tnbUXeijR6t_TQzSpPwHNNGn0dcByPMtAS6Wdg><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Life is hard, no one gets through it without facing some sort of challenge or adversity. These are Dwight’s top three things that you need to be on the lookout for.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>8. “All you need is love. False. The four basic human necessities are air, water, food, and shelter.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dwight-quote-eight.png><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>On the flip side, there are things you should be looking to get out of life. In Dwight’s view, love isn’t one of them. Seriously, in the age of swipe dating apps, forget about it. Just make sure you have a roof over your head.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>9. “At first, I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean, the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dwight-quote-nine.png><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Life will continue to throw curveballs at you, and occasionally you will make mistakes. That’s okay, just remember to be like Dwight and reflect on and learn from those mistakes.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>10. “You’re a perfectly fine toilet. I’m just an extraordinary piece of crap.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dwight-quote-ten.png><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Now, let’s round out with why exactly we should turn to Dwight for sage advice about how we should lead our lives.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>11. “No, don’t call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning and go into their normal jobs and get a distress call from the Commissioner and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh6.googleusercontent.com/rqIvT91zoETs7s2IOf_uq5Tgs6Og6EAI_5iwwh3B-1ch9u7j3HE-4UoXdDuGUgUba5dmLndH1LHEehEYZXoL-Ms0V6G9vLhT9AR_MvWTnaGIFZ6Q0LtMcaDi4RipVCxgV5UOM2VVvcARJdArMidZ9aN4FHYCZdMtb00Mo8mI3OTJ36uuuPBQ9-v8rA><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=false>And finally, he doesn’t want your thanks for the wisdom, for he is just a man and not a hero.
