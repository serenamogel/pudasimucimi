Considering each <b>ref referees</b> more or less three fights per night, they can <b>earn</b> around $1200 a night.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-ufc-referees-know-how-do-you-fight></span>Do UFC referees know how do you fight?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>UFC referee’s</b> job may be different than the fighter’s job, but the <b>refs</b> still need to <b>know how to fight</b> before they get inside the octagon.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-do-mma-referees-do></span>What do MMA referees do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Although the judges and <b>referees</b> are different types of <b>MMA</b> officials, the <b>referees</b> have to know how to score to be able to follow the <b>fight</b> and to apply all the rules. They also have to know when and what for they can and must deduce points, which can influence the outcome if the match goes to the judges.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-get-scouted-for-ufc></span>How do you get scouted for UFC?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-hard-is-it-to-get-into-ufc></span>How hard is it to get into UFC?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It’s not too <b>hard</b> to <b>get</b> a fight in the <b>UFC</b>. Win 8 or so fights at the local level against bums to pad your record and you can probably <b>get</b> a contract. Now fighting at the top level in the <b>UFC</b>, say <b>getting</b> a title shot, is incredibly <b>difficult</b> since you are no longer hand picking fights at the local level.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-hard-is-it-to-be-a-ufc-fighter></span>How hard is it to be a UFC fighter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>MMA is a VERY <b>tough</b> sport, and it takes a lot of time, energy, and <b>hard</b> work for it to even be rewarding. If you don’t love learning it and training, or aren’t winning a lot of money, and aren’t willing to have injuries, setbacks, and <b>difficult</b> moments, you probably should reconsider doing it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-ufc-a-good-career></span>Is UFC a good career?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Mixed Martial Arts is obviously a <b>good career</b> but make sure you have the courage to bear painful blows from your opponents. If you too want to become a <b>successful</b> MMA fighter, make sure you are training your mind besides working on your physical strength.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-being-a-ufc-fighter-worth-it></span>Is being a UFC fighter worth it?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>No—it’s not <b>worth it</b> for the money. If someone gets involved in MMA for the money, they’ve chosen the wrong competitive sport. You do it because you want to fight and because you love the sport.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-mma-a-bad-career></span>Is MMA a bad career?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yes it sucks to be a <b>MMA</b> fighter. There is only a very very very small chance of you becoming a rich superstar. Apart from that you will just have an average income, no other <b>career</b> opportunities besides opening a gym and a lot of physical mileage and possible brain damage.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-worth-becoming-a-mma-fighter></span>Is it worth becoming a MMA fighter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It’s a great avenue career path for athletes that only have/had the Olympics dream and nothing else. Over time <b>MMA</b> will get bigger and have better world class athletes. But by then when the pay is mainstream sport-like. About 90 <b>fights</b> between <b>MMA</b> and kickboxing, and he lost almost 2/3 of them.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-start-mma-at-30></span>Can you start MMA at 30?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If you start</b> young your beat up by <b>30</b>. Injuries are almost unavoidable in this sport. In my opinion, most often, <b>MMA</b> fighters don’t reach their full potential for this reason. <b>If you</b> get a late <b>start</b> to <b>MMA</b>, but <b>we</b>‘re athletic and fit, <b>you</b> have your “man” strength, wisdom, and life knowledge.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-hard-is-mma-training></span>How hard is MMA training?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>As fun and rewarding as <b>MMA</b> can be, it’s also <b>HARD</b>. Preparing to fight for as much as 25 minutes in the cage (which is the amount of time in a championship 5-round fight that goes the distance) is physically taxing. There are days where the brutal warmups alone are going to make you want to quit.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-21-too-old-to-start-mma></span>Is 21 too old to start MMA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You can definitely achieve professional status, even in the UFC, <b>starting</b> at <b>21</b>. There are multiple guys i train with/around who are coming into their pro careers now with ages between 20-25.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-40-too-old-to-start-mma></span>Is 40 too old to start MMA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yes, there are some <b>older</b> pro-<b>MMA</b> fighters at some of the larger promotions but they have been at it for a long time. <b>Starting</b> off as an amateur fighter at <b>40</b> (looking to go pro) is a long shot. I have trained amateur and professional <b>mma</b> fighters for more than ten years. No, it’s not <b>too old</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-18-too-old-to-start-mma></span>Is 18 too old to start MMA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You can never be <b>too</b> young to <b>start MMA</b>. The earlier you <b>start</b>, the better. Most people <b>start</b> around the ages of 8 and 9. The earlier you <b>start</b>, the stronger your bones get, along with your muscles.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-17-too-old-to-start-mma></span>Is 17 too old to start MMA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>age</b> of 16 or <b>17</b> is a fine <b>age to begin</b> training in the arts that will form the foundation of your <b>MMA</b> game, if that’s what you’re asking. The <b>age</b> of 16 or <b>17</b> is a fine <b>age to begin</b> training in the arts that will form the foundation of your <b>MMA</b> game, if that’s what you’re asking.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-19-too-old-to-start-mma></span>Is 19 too old to start MMA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yes you can <b>start</b> training at any <b>age</b>. But if you want to compete professionally, i would say its <b>late</b> especially if you are not a Heavyweight. Because most successful <b>MMA</b> Fighters started their training even before their teenage. But if you are a Heavyweight then things are better.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-18-too-old-to-start-jiu-jitsu></span>Is 18 too old to start Jiu Jitsu?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You’re fine. I know someone who’s been doing <b>BJJ</b> for less than 4 years and they’re competing at ADCC. You can get there pretty quick if you put in the work. Anyone can sign up for ADCC.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-start-jiu-jitsu-at-50></span>Can I start Jiu Jitsu at 50?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You <b>can</b> definitely <b>start</b> your <b>Jiu</b>–<b>Jitsu</b> journey in your 40s, 50s and even 60s, but that doesn’t mean it’ll be as easy as <b>starting</b> it at 18. If you plan on taking up <b>BJJ</b>, you’ll need to <b>do</b> your best to get adequate sleep. By now you should know what a good night’s rest feels like. Try and get that as much as possible.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-50-too-old-for-jiu-jitsu></span>Is 50 too old for Jiu Jitsu?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The answer is simple: “NO!” We have students over 40 years <b>old</b> on the mat training with us, “You are NOT <b>too old</b> to start training <b>Jiu</b>–<b>jitsu</b>, but you will get way <b>older</b> when you do NOT train <b>jiu</b>–<b>jitsu</b>”. One of our students Louis Choi maintains a high level of fitness through <b>Jiu</b>–<b>jitsu</b> after the age of <b>50</b>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6o7HCqKSeZZFiwqevjKucn52imrJufo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
