Fittingly, the song that launched him to stardom, the 1970 single “Fire and Rain,” summoned and encapsulated the tragedies, setbacks and struggles that had marked his life to that point.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with his finger-picking guitar work and sweet, soothing voice, Taylor is known for his immensely personal lyrics, which often juxtaposed the music to which they were set with tales of sadness, heartbreak and depression. “Fire and Rain” was the epitome of Taylor’s from-the-heart lyrical style, and to understand what he’s singing about, it’s imperative to know a bit about his early life and career.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Taylor struggled with his mental health as a teenager</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though a bright student, Taylor was plagued by depression, which was exacerbated by family turmoil and instability. By 15 years old, he’d already begun performing music in coffee shops and other small venues in his native Massachusetts and adopted home of North Carolina, showing flashes of his genius, but he was having trouble keeping his head above water at school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“My folks were educated people, and they had expectations. I assumed it meant finishing school, finding a career, probably an academic one,” he told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/greg-kot/ct-james-taylor-ott-20160620-column.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chicago Tribune" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chicago Tribune</a> many years later. “But my family fell apart (through divorce), and I fell apart. It was mysterious to me why. I had no expectations of what would happen to me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Flailing in school, Taylor dropped out his senior year and instead checked himself into McLean, a psychological hospital of great renown in Massachusetts. He spent the end of 1965 and much of 1966 in recovery at the facility before checking himself out after nine months and went <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5779001/james-taylor-comeback-memoir/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="up to New York’s East Village" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">up to New York’s East Village</a> to begin his musical career.</p><img alt="James Taylor" title="James Taylor" width=3092 height=3192 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3204731.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">James Taylor in 1969; Photo: Jack Robinson/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">His years in New York brought his first tastes of success and addiction</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The next few years were a whirlwind for Taylor. In New York, he plugged into the Village music scene, where cafes overflowed with musicians and low-rent apartments were infested with drugs. Taylor plunged headfirst into both of them, forming a band called v<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-flying-machine-mn0001888550 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Flying Machine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Flying Machine</a> and falling in with heroin addicts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The drummer from my band, The Flying Machine, was a heroin addict,” Taylor <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-taylors-family-addiction_n_5654e881e4b072e9d1c1052a data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=told class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told</a> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/oprah-winfrey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oprah Winfrey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Oprah Winfrey</a> in 2015. “It was a matter of time before I got my first taste. And I was gone. As soon as I was introduced to opiates, I was gone.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It turned out that Taylor’s family had a long history of addiction, especially to opioids, and even at one point owned a sanitarium dedicated to helping people kick the habit. It was a dark time — The Flying Machine’s album never made it past demo tapes and Taylor, strung out and dependent on drugs, wound up being whisked back home to North Carolina, where he’d check into rehab. This began a multi-year cycle of recovery and relapse, with Taylor deciding to get high as his career began its ascension, as well.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“People argue about substance abuse and whether or not addiction is genetically predisposed,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-taylors-family-addiction_n_5654e881e4b072e9d1c1052a data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="later reflected" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">later reflected</a>. “I think it probably is. There’s definitely that gene in my family. Whether it’s nature or nurture, we tend to be addicted.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After rehab, Taylor moved to England, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.james-taylor.com/db/jt/biography/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="set up his own little recording studio" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">set up his own little recording studio</a>, and then scored an audition for The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/how-the-beatles-formed data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Beatles class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Beatles</a>’ new record label, Apple Records. He earned a contract and spent plenty of time at the studio, recording at the same time that The Beatles were putting down the White Album. The flow of creativity was rivaled only by the flow of drugs; Taylor had <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/17/james-taylor-i-was-a-bad-influence-on-the-beatles-lennon-love-and-a-life-in-song data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="access to plenty of cheap heroin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">access to plenty of cheap heroin</a> in London, and he eventually returned to the United States with a modestly successful debut self-titled album and another serious drug habit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was a chaotic, productive and shambolic 1968, and it set the stage for another year of highs and lows that would ultimately lead him to “Fire and Rain.”</p><img alt="James Taylor" title="James Taylor" width=3758 height=2692 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-88134692.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">James Taylor in 2006; Photo: KMazur/WireImage for The Recording Academy</span></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The song's verses each detail a hardship in Taylor's life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Taylor got back from London, he played major festivals, garnered modest acclaim, and then promptly hit the skids again when he crashed his motorcycle. That fall, he moved in with his then-girlfriend <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/joni-mitchell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joni Mitchell" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Joni Mitchell</a> in Los Angeles but soon checked in to rehab once again. His stay wound up being remarkably productive, even if he didn’t fully shake his addiction to heroin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was in rehab that Taylor wrote a majority of his second album, Sweet Baby James, including that first smash hit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The song has three verses, each detailing a hardship or sad moment in his life. The opening lines, “Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone/Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you,” referred to a friend named Suzanne Schnerr, who he knew during his time in New York. They were close pals for a while, riding the ups and downs of the music scene and heroin, and a few years after he left the city, Schnerr wound up taking her own life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"At the time, I was recording in England with The Beatles, and my friends had sort of kept the information about this death from me because they thought, you know, `This is a crucial time for him, he's doing his work, and we don't want to upset him or bring him down,’” Taylor told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2000/06/26/1075908/npr-100-fire-and-rain data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=NPR class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">NPR</a> years later. “So my friend Richard Corey told me about it, but he had known about it for a month or so before he mentioned it to me. So that's where 'they let me know you were gone' comes in."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In an interview for a biography published in 2001, Taylor said that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://americansongwriter.com/james-taylor-fire-and-rain-behind-the-song/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he didn’t find out" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">he didn’t find out</a> about Schnerr’s death until six months after she took her own life. The news hit hard, contributing to an anxiety and unease that fed into the heroin habit he was trying to kick when he wrote the song. That addiction informed the second verse, where he sings, “Won’t you look down upon me, Jesus / You’ve got to help me make a stand / You’ve just got to see me through another day,” putting out a call for help as he struggled through withdrawal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Similarly, the third verse takes inspiration from his time at McLean and the pain that came with the failure of The Flying Machines, which he slyly name-checks near the end, singing, “Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The song was laid down in the studio in late 1969 and released as the first single on Sweet Baby James when it came out in 1970. It became his calling card, a deeply personal track that seemed to connect with everyone. It hit number three on the Billboard charts and has <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ig.ft.com/life-of-a-song/fire-and-rain.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="been covered more than 80 times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">been covered more than 80 times</a>, including by some of the most prominent musicians of the 20th century.
