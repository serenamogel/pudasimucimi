News broke that Kim and Kanye were headed toward a divorce after six years of marriage on Tuesday, January 5. The couple, who married in 2014 after three years of dating, share four kids: daughters North, 7, and Chicago, 2, and sons Saint, 5, and Psalm, 1.</p><p>After the news broke, a rumor was posted on TikTok by user @realavalouiise that <a href=# rel=noopener>Kanye</a> had been “hooking up with a very famous beauty guru, male beauty guru” for a while. Louise claimed that she’s known about the gossip “for months,” which is why it came as “no surprise” that <a href=# rel=noopener>Kanye’s marriage with Kim</a> was on its way <a href=# rel=noopener>toward divorce</a>. “A lot of people in the scene have known for a while,” Louise, who has 554,000 TikTok followers, said in the video.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-kanye-west.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kim-kardashian-odell-beckham-jr.png><p>Louise went on to like comments from viewers who asked if the beauty guru was Jeffree. She claimed in a second TikTok video that her friend is a <a href=# rel=noopener>celebrity lawyer</a> in Los Angeles met with Kim months ago and “was given evidence” about Kanye’s alleged affair with Jeffree. The rumors spread even more after fans saw that Jeffree deleted a 2011 tweet in which he claimed to have hung out with Kanye at a party. “last night was so fun! xoxo,” Jeffree wrote in a since-deleted tweet to Kanye. Louise later told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Insider</a> that she couldn’t provide “concrete evidence” to her claims. That said, it didn’t take long for the rumors spread across the internet, with Jeffree responding.</p><a title=@realavalouiise href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@realavalouiise</a>i can’t say WHO cuz he’ll sue me hint hint but it’s part of the reason Kanye’s so religious now it’s his self hatred …. my source is legit I promiss<a title="♬ original sound - Ava Louise" href=# rel="noopener nofollow">♬ original sound – Ava Louise</a><br><p>In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Jeffree broke his silence on the rumors by posting a photo of him in a pink robe with the caption: “I’m ready for Sunday Service 🕊,” a reference to Kanye’s Sunday Service. Jeffree also tagged himself in Caspar, Wyoming. As fans know, Kanye owns a $14 million ranch in Cody, Wyoming, which is three hours from Caspar, where Jeffree has a part-time residence.</p><p>Jeffree also responded to the rumors in a text to Twitter user @KeemStar, the owner behind the YouTube account DramaAlert. In the tweet, Keem asked the YouTuber, “Jeffree what do I say about these current rumors with you and Kanye.” Jeffree then responded, “Hahaha. I’m having the best time in Wyoming, come visit sometime!”</p><p>So what’s the truth? It looks like the rumors are false and Jeffree is just trolling fans. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> on Wednesday that there’s “no truth” to the speculation. “There is absolutely no truth to Jeffree and Kanye rumors,” the insider said. Well, there’s that.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg alt="New Entertainment Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kHFsam5pZLemssWrnJ5lo6mus3nRnqqpp56ZwG63wKewnmWnmsC1ecKhnJqsXaC2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK6jJ2gr6eimLJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
