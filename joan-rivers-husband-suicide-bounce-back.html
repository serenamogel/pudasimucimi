She was playing sold-out shows all over the country. She released a new book, Enter Talking.

After more than two decades of climbing the comedy ladder with her brassy, spitfire humor, the self-proclaimed “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/23/archives/westchester-weekly-joan-rivers-sings-paean-to-larchmont-joan-rivers.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="last girl in Larchmont" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">last girl in Larchmont</a>” had finally become a real star.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">1986 was also the year Fox offered Rivers her own show — as a competitor to The Tonight Show. After Rivers accepted the offer, Carson — her friend, mentor, and champion of 20 years — <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/joan-rivers-johnny-carson-feud data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="never spoke to her again" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">never spoke to her again</a>. By 1987, the ratings on The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers were less-than-stellar, and Fox fired her. Later that year River’s husband and producer, Edgar Rosenberg, killed himself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Faced with personal tragedy and humiliating professional defeat, Rivers didn’t give up. Instead, she reinvented herself, and by the 2000s returned to the center of the conversation — bigger and better than ever.</p><img alt="Joan Rivers and her husband Edgar Rosenberg" title="Joan Rivers and her husband Edgar Rosenberg" width=2322 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joan-rivers-and-her-husband-edgar-rosenberg-february-1983-photo-by-the-life-picture-collectiongetty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span><p>Joan Rivers and her husband, Edgar Rosenberg, in February 1983</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Unlike her late-night show, River's daytime talk show was a huge success</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1989, less than two years after her husband’s death, Rivers went back to work. She developed a new daytime television program, The Joan Rivers Show. Unlike her ill-fated foray into late-night, The Joan Rivers Show was an immediate hit. Rivers won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 1990, and the show was nominated for several other awards. It ran for five seasons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also in 1990, Rivers began her long-running association with the QVC channel, where she sold her own line of (usually bedazzled) jewelry, clothing and accessories. At the time, Rivers chalked up the decision to start hawking her wares to debt: “In those days only dead celebrities went on [QVC]," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.silive.com/entertainment/2014/09/joan_rivers_flashback_comedy_i.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told the Staten Island Advance" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she told the Staten Island Advance</a> in 2004. “My career was over. I had a lot of bills to pay. I have a very large family and we all take care of each other.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.qvc.com/jewelry/joan-rivers-classics-collection/_/N-mfluZ1z12weq/c.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joan Rivers Classics Collection" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Joan Rivers Classics Collection</a> would turn into an enormously successful venture, however, amassing over <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://stylecaster.com/joan-rivers-qvc-collection-1-billion-dollars/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$1 billion" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">$1 billion</a> in sales and becoming one of QVC’s top-selling lines. Moreover, her appearances on the shopping channel — which continued until her death in 2014 — became yet another venue to make people laugh.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rivers and her daughter teamed up for a TV movie as a form of therapy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1994, Rivers and her daughter, Melissa, teamed up to publicly reckon with Edgar’s suicide in the form of a made-for-TV movie.&nbsp;Tears and Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story premiered in May of that year, with the pair playing real-life versions of themselves as they come to terms with Edgar’s death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At first, critics accused Rivers of exploiting the tragedy for dramatic effect; later many credited the film with helping destigmatize suicide. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSqpKcAoeKU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rivers said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rivers said</a> she paid no mind to the initial backlash. “It was very therapeutic for Melissa and me,” she said. “Edgar’s death was so raw. So we bonded tremendously.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The same year, E! asked Rivers to host the Golden Globes pre-show red carpet. In 1995, she and Melissa hosted the carpet for the Academy Awards, interviewing celebrities as they paraded by.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Melissa knew someone at E!,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/08/red-carpet-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rivers explained to Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rivers explained to Vanity Fair</a> in 2014. “And they were saying, ‘Who should we put out on the red carpet?’ It is a horrible job and no one was doing it then. And Melissa said, ‘My mother.’” Rivers added, “It was a very low time for me.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rivers became a red carpet staple</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stepping onto the red carpet turned out to be another smart move. With their biting commentary and snappy banter,&nbsp; the mother/daughter duo breathed new life into the staid pre-show ritual. The pair even came up with the now-standard line, “Who are you wearing?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Fashion is fun, and that’s the way it should be,” Rivers told Vanity Fair. She would host the red carpet for E! until 2004, and later the hit series Fashion Police from 2010-2014, where she cemented her status as a fully-fledged style authority.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 2014, Rivers had been the subject of a critically-acclaimed documentary,&nbsp;Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work, authored nine more books and was routinely performing clubs across the country. She had made it back on top.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“People love to build you up, and then they love to destroy you,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vogue.com/article/joan-rivers-interview-vogue-archive data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rivers told Vogue" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rivers told Vogue</a> in May 1986, right before her life would fall apart and come back together. “And then they love to venerate you at the end.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8Bwts6apWaqmauys7%2BMoaysmpGjsW6%2F1KKaopyVYq%2Bwwc2cnGaakZi4</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
