However, as a result of the ongoing Writer’s Guild strike, we may need to wait just that little bit longer, according to series lead Joel McHale.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a> promoting McHale’s latest series Animal Control, the actor weighed in on the strike, saying he is 100% behind writers petitioning for better pay.
