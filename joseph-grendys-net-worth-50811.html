His <a href=#>Father</a> was a butcher who was also involved in the wholesale and <a href=#>Retail</a> meat trade. His grandparents emigrated to the US from <a href=#>Poland</a>.</p><span>1980</span><p>Grendys started full-time at Koch Foods in the mid-1980s, when it had just 13 employees. The owner Fred Koch was one of his father's customers, having started Koch Foods in 1973, and offered him a 50% equity share in the <a href=#>Business</a>.</p><span>1984</span><p>He was educated at Holy Cross High School in River Grove, and worked at Koch Foods part-time while a student. In 1984, he received a bachelor's degree in <a href=#>Finance</a> and Marketing from Loyola University.</p><span>1992</span><p>He bought out Fred Koch in 1992. Grendys' companies now slaughter, ship and sell chicken using the Koch Foods, Antioch Farms, Preferred Foods and Rogers Royal brands. Koch slaughters over 12 million chickens and processes over 50,000,000 pounds (23,000&nbsp;t) of chicken every week.</p><span>2011</span><p>In 2011, Koch employed 14,000 people, had an annual turnover of $2.8 billion, and was one of America's five largest "fully-integrated chicken processors".</p><span>2014</span><p>In a 2014 interview, Grendys stated that he planned to acquire more companies and that he might branch out into another protein, but that he was "not sure what that protein would be yet". Rather than running a chicken company, he sees it as "the <a href=#>Business</a> of converting corn and soybeans into meat protein".</p><span>2018</span><p>As of February 2018, <i>Forbes</i> estimated his net worth at US$2.9 billion.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1960s births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>American billionaires</a> <a href=#>American people of Polish descent</a> <a href=#>Businesspeople from Chicago</a> <a href=#>Loyola University Chicago alumni</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeapMCmvMdmnqudnpnGtHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5lGlvamk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
