She had a transient childhood, moving from place to place because of her father’s military service. Always changing schools, Julianne found herself targeted by bullies who picked on her for her now famous traits. “When I was 7, these kids in the alley behind our house in Omaha called me ‘Freckleface Strawberry.’ I hated my freckles, and I hated that name,” she later explained to Redbook.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After attending high school in Germany, Julianne returned to the United States to study at Boston University. She graduated from the university’s School of Performing Arts in 1983 and soon moved to New York City to break into the theater world.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Movies and TV Shows" data-anchor-id=movies-and-tv-shows class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Movies and TV Shows</h2><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">As The World Turns and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1985, Moore landed her first major television role: She played Frannie Hughes on the soap opera As the World Turns for several years, eventually taking on the dual role of her character’s twin sister, Sabrina.
