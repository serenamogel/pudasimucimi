It's a&nbsp;fairy tale-inflected period piece&nbsp;that has a slightly&nbsp;different look and feel&nbsp;from the Pixar-DreamWorks-Blue Sky&nbsp;usual— essentially '90s Disney by way of 19th storybook illustrations and much older&nbsp;woodcuts. Pablos came up during the final years of Walt Disney's traditional, hand-drawn animation department, working on such blockbusters as "<a href=#>Tarzan</a>," "<a href=#>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a>," and "Hercules." Even though "Klaus" was made digitally, you can feel the influence of that period. The images are intricately&nbsp;molded and&nbsp;shaded, and composed in a way that often mimics a lavishly budgeted, live-action Disney&nbsp;fantasy; but the film isn't knocking itself out to convince you that anything onscreen&nbsp;is "real," in the manner of recent Disney 3-D animated remakes like "The Lion King," or even "<a href=#>Toy Story 4</a>," with its photorealistic roads, rain, and foliage. I doubt pens ever touched ink&nbsp;except at the concept stage, yet the whole thing feels sketched and painted&nbsp;by human hands, and both the landscapes and the characters' movements are more about realizing dramatic or comic&nbsp;notions&nbsp;than making you think anything in the story&nbsp;could "really happen."</p><p>The writing (by Pablos, Zach Lewis and <a href=#>Jim Mahoney</a>)&nbsp;is less distinctive:&nbsp;a&nbsp;"selfish person learns to care about others" storyline; anachronistic dialogue packed with slang that'll be dated in a year, and moments where characters high-five each other, which I'm pretty sure wasn't common in the 19th century; a rather thin&nbsp;"strong woman" character who is mainly there to enable and reflect the hero's evolution&nbsp;(Rashida Jones' fishmarket butcher, who used to be a schoolteacher back when the citizenry cared about&nbsp;learning stuff). And of course there are&nbsp;occasional&nbsp;pop songs on the soundtrack, a practice that has become mandatory in animated features post-"<a href=#>Shrek</a>."&nbsp;</p><p>But because the&nbsp;Pixar-DreamWorks-Blue Sky&nbsp;usual is&nbsp;the only kind of animation that's allowed into mainstream theaters right&nbsp;now, even a minor variation is so commercially poisonous&nbsp;for animators that "Klaus"—the umpteenth version of one of the most-retold stories in history, and a film that fits the&nbsp;marketplace&nbsp;template pretty well, all things considered—was&nbsp;reportedly hard&nbsp;to fund. It&nbsp;was finally&nbsp;made by Netflix, and (following a brief theatrical run) it&nbsp;will mainly be seen on TVs,&nbsp;laptops, and phones&nbsp;rather than on theater screens, where its most distinctive qualities are more likely to be appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a business story in all of this, and not one that will gladden young&nbsp;animators' hearts. I'm not a kid anymore, but I still might write a letter to Santa this year asking for the range of artistic possibilities for commercial animation to open up again, so that films like "Klaus"—and Laika animated features like "<a href=#>Coraline</a>" and "<a href=#>Missing Link</a>," and idiosyncratic&nbsp;imports like "A Cat in Paris" and "<a href=#>Funan</a>"—won't be treated like troubling deviations from the norm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46ko5qto2K6sMLInmSrnaaesrh5kWlocg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
