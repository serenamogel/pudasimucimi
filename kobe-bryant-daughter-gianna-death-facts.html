He was a five-time NBA champion, 18-time All-Star, two-time NBA finals MVP — and two-time Olympic gold medalist to boot. And unlike players who zig-zagged around through teams, for all <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://obits.cleveland.com/obituaries/cleveland/obituary.aspx?n=kobe-bryant&pid=195169737" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="20 seasons" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">20 seasons</a> he played, he remained a Los Angeles Laker. In 2006, he scored 81 points in a single game — the second-highest in NBA history. Even though he retired from the sport in 2016, scoring an impressive 60 points in his final game, he found his way in other realms, most notably winning an Oscar in 2018 for his animated short Dear Basketball.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite all that greatness, what made Bryant most human was his love for his family — his wife Vanessa, who he married in 2001, and their four daughters, Natalia, Gianna, Bianka and Capri.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And ultimately, it was for the love of basketball and his daughter Gianna that he met his untimely end that Sunday morning on his way to the second day of his daughter’s basketball tournament.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Bryant spent the previous day at a basketball tournament and with his family</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The weekend was an exciting one in the Bryant household.

Of course, with the tournament being held at a Thousand Oaks gym co-owned by Bryant called Mamba Academy (<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://sportsacademy.us/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="later renamed Sports Academy," class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">later renamed Sports Academy,</a> out of respect to Bryant), the basketball legend himself was the star attraction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nevertheless, for him, his eyes were on his family. He rushed home to Orange County, avoiding Southern California traffic by going by helicopter, and by about 5 p.m., he was at the Fashion Island mall in Newport Beach with his then 3-year-old Bianka, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/ct-nyt-kobe-bryant-helicopter-20200209-bwrxxzdhnbhstmdxyzaacas6p4-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=enjoying class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">enjoying</a> looking at the koi fish in the pond.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though he was focused on family time, he was well aware that across the country in his hometown of Philadelphia, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/lebron-james data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="LeBron James" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">LeBron James</a> beat his career-points record, knocking Bryant into fourth place.

By 7 a.m, he had already stopped by his Catholic church, Our Lady Queen of Angels, since he had to get from his Newport Coast home to John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana by 9 a.m. in order to catch the helicopter to get to day two of the tournament in time for the team’s first game at 12 noon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Bryant had been focused on getting his daughter and her teammates to the game, his private helicopter’s team had long been preparing for the flight. The day before, a group text had been started among the crew members. Pilot Ara Zobayan and the flight coordinator had been texting about the conditions and within an hour of departure, the coordinator asked how things looked for the 9 a.m. departure. “Should be OK,” Zobayan replied with the coordinator replying, “I agree,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/us/kobe-bryant-flight-ntsb-text-messages-weather-pilot/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">CNN</a> reported of the texts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Other flights that were scheduled to leave that morning had been grounded because the official visibility around the airport was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/ct-nyt-kobe-bryant-helicopter-20200209-bwrxxzdhnbhstmdxyzaacas6p4-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="only four miles" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">only four miles</a>.
