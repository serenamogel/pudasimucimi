Let me tell you a personal story involving Daffy Duck, which also takes place on the Warners lot. I quote from an interview I did with <a href=#>Albert Brooks</a> in 1991, when his new movie "<a href=#>Defending Your Life</a>" was about to be released.</p><p>As I was getting up to leave his office, Brooks said, "Look at these funny coffee mugs the studio sent over."</p><p>He had four or five of them on a shelf, cups shaped like the Warners cartoon heroes.</p><p>"Here," he said. "Have one. I want you to have one."</p><p>He pressed Elmer Fudd into my hands.</p><p>"No, that's OK," I said.</p><p>"Take one. What is this, a bribe? They're worth 10 cents apiece; 25 cents, tops."</p><p>"You know," I said, looking at the shelf, "I've never really been a fan of Elmer Fudd. My hero has always been Daffy Duck."</p><p>Brooks took the Daffy Duck mug from the shelf.</p><p>"Here, take it," he said. "I want you to have it. Really."</p><p>I could tell from the subtle intonation in his voice exactly what had happened. He had given me Elmer Fudd because he didn't like Elmer Fudd, either. He liked Daffy Duck. I had taken his favorite mug.</p><p>"No, you keep Daffy," I said. "I'll bet it's your favorite."</p><p>"Come on, come on," he said. "Take Daffy Duck. Take the one you want."</p><p>I tried to put Daffy back on the shelf. He pressed Daffy into my hands. I left with Daffy, but I would have bet a hundred bucks that the moment I was out of his office, Brooks had his secretary call Warners to see if they could send another Daffy Duck over.</p><p>And so now we are back in the present, and my eyes lift up from this review and regard the very same Daffy Duck coffee mug, which has pride of place in my office. And I reflect that while things always came easily for Bugs, Daffy had to fight every inch of the way. Bugs was insouciant. Daffy was outraged. Bugs was always a step ahead. Daffy was always a step behind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lpqimla56tcHNnqpmmpGYuG61zWaYnKyZpLtufo9pag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
