(Although Jordan called her the Duchess of Ray Ridge, Nadine doesn’t have aristocratic roots.) The transition was ceremoniously marked with the purchase of a yacht that was originally owned by Coco Chanel and renamed after Nadine.</p><p><strong>Minor spoiler alert…</strong></p><p>Just as Wolf of Wall Street shows, Jordan and Nadine’s marriage was largely unhappy. Not only was Jordan habitually doing drugs and prostitutes, but he was also busted for major financial crimes. (We detailed his charges in a <a title="How Jordan Belfort, the real Wolf of Wall Street, defrauded investors out of $200 million" href=#>previous post</a>.) As Jordan told <a href=#>The Telegraph</a> in 2008, the Belforts’ relationship bottomed out after he kicked her down the stairs, put his 3-year-old daughter in the car and got into a driveway accident in the late 1990s. After that, Jordan went to rehab and Nadine went to divorce lawyers.</p><p>Amazingly, Jordan claims he and Nadine have a solid friendship these days. As of his 2008 interview with The Telegraph, the former spouses were living miles apart in California and co-parenting their two children.<br><br></p><p></p><a title="web analytics" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c.statcounter.com/8621503/0/eead5755/1/ alt="web analytics" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p></p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkurCwxKWgp59dpbWwwM6sZKieXaOupbXNnmSbnZybvLPAjLCgn51dpLNuwMeeZKudkaF6uLvLn2Sonl2srq24jKyrq52VqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
