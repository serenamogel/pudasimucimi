With numerous military groups, from the Taliban to Pakistan’s ISI, on their tail, Tom and Mo try to make it through the dangerous desert.</p><p>While dodging several attempts on their lives, Tom and Mo form a bond along the way.

With an advanced skillset and an apparent death wish, Tyler travels to a heavily guarded city to bring Ovi to safety. Like ‘Warhorse One,’ ‘<a href=#>Extraction</a>‘ also revolves around one lone man’s mission of rescuing a child from a violent situation.
