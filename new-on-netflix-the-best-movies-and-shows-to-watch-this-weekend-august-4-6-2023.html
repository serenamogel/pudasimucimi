Just as the streaming giant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">says goodbye to an arsenal of series</a> and films ahead of the summer’s ending, several more are entering Netflix for the very first time – and just in time to catch them all <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">before the school year begins</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>In fact, more and more additions to the library will be welcomed until the end of the month, with plenty of exclusive original series launching for the very first time, alongside the new content added to the platform that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was already pre-existing somewhere else</a>. With that in mind, here are some of the best movies and shows that were added to Netflix thus far, and can certainly be a comforting presence for the next weekend to come.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bee-movie data-injectable=false>Bee Movie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bee-Movie.jpg><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=865 data-injectable=true>Whether you want to watch it for the laughs or rewatch it because you truly enjoy it, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bee Movie</a> was added to the platform’s repertoire on August 1, finally giving everyone a chance to fully experience the unique spectacle that is the one and only Bee Movie. The film was released in 2007, and it immediately became a joke among virtually everyone. While it is a fantastic family film with impressive animation, it’s worth noting that it portrays a relationship between a human and a bee. What else would anyone watch on a Saturday afternoon, right?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Fast & Furious</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dwayne-Johnson-as-Luke-Hobbs-in-Fast-and-furious.jpg><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=847 data-injectable=true>Oh that’s right, action fans, your favorite speedrunning franchise <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast & Furious</a> is finally available on Netflix. On August 1, the platform welcomed a bunch of films from the franchise for the very first time, including 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast & Furious, Fast Five, The Fast, and the Furious, and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Avid fans of the saga will quickly realize that there are quite a few titles missing to complete the franchise, but hey, it’s definitely more than enough to keep us all busy for the weekend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Ugly Betty</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ugly-Betty.jpg><p data-characters=610 data-current-count=910 data-injectable=true>As for the realm of series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ugly Betty</a> also arrived on the platform on August 1, perfectly timed for fans of<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> America Ferrera </a>to finally get their fix, especially after leaving the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a> cinema room. Ugly Betty premiered on our screens in 2006 and gained a massive following, particularly among teenagers who could perhaps find solace in seeing a character who didn’t conform to the beauty standards of the time. Although somewhat outdated (since when do glasses and braces make someone ugly, really?), the show still showcases a young Ferrera absolutely killing it in her role as the kind-hearted Betty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Lost in Translation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/p08zb503.jpg><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>For cinephiles, Netflix is also attending to your needs for a good and intense watch. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost in Translation</a> was finally included in the library at the start of the month, and more and more people can now truly immerse themselves in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sofia Coppola</a>‘s cinematic grandeur from 2004. Lost in Translation won several accolades in its debut year and was nominated for numerous Oscars. So if you’re considering watching some of the best from the very best, Lost in Translation is definitely the way to go.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Heartstopper Season 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Joe-Locke-and-Kit-Connor-as-Charlie-and-Nick-in-Heartstopper-.jpg><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartstopper</a> is back today, and a bed of hype has been made and tucked for everyone to get ready and binge-watch the entire season. Just a little over a year ago, the series debuted an adaptation of the original Alice Oseman comic by the same name, and since then, fans have never looked back. The incredible interpretation of the beloved characters is absolutely terrific, and the second season is just the best possible way to welcome the weekend in a good mood, with slight a hint of drama.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Despicable Me</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/despicable-me.jpg><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=847 data-injectable=true>Gru and the Minions are now on Netflix, and regardless of how insufferable these little yellow banana addicts may be, the entire film is definitely worth all the hype – trust me, I’ve watched it twice already against my will and enjoyed every second of it. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Despicable Me</a> and Despicable Me 2 are both available on the platform since the start of the month, and whether you just want some well-humored fun time, or have little ones you might wish to entertain, Despicable Me will surely be the perfect pick for the kids and the adults alike.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>With these new additions in mind, have a great weekend and enjoy Coppola’s wondrous work, followed by the minions for a good dose of duality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdZmpqdlnprBp7jIsWStoJVir6a%2F02akqK6ZmsBurc2dZKygn6zAbsDOZq6arJOderW0yKxksJ2VoLKvsIyarKCto6l6dXmVZmlpamNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
