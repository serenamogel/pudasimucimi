They did not spare the 49ers fans who came to the <strong>Lincoln Financial Field</strong>&nbsp;to watch their team have a meltdown.

The video showed a young kid wearing Eagles‚Äô star wide receiver DeVonta Smith‚Äôs jersey. The pre pubescent boy approached a 49ers‚Äô fan who had donned a Nick Bosa jersey for a high five. As the man, who was around his mid-30s, happily obliged, the Philly fanboy flipped him the bird. The man laughed out loud as the young boy trolled him and his team. They really do teach them young in Philadelphia!</p><p>NFL fans on Twitter were divided into two factions. While some took it as a joke and were appreciative of the man for laughing it off, others starting babbling on about where the kid‚Äôs parents were, whether didn‚Äôt they teach him any manner, and so on.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Little homie has the all makings of a future menace to society</p>‚Äî Francisco (@papapanch616) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>me personally i would‚Äôve laughed if a kid did that to me bc that‚Äôs hella funny</p>‚Äî Mister Snow Miser Diana (@bedazzlingenby) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lol these Philly fans feel good about the win against no QB</p>‚Äî Travis Storhaug (@Travis123123) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wild that this guy can keep his cool longer than Joey Bosa üòÇ</p>‚Äî Jay Strads (@jaystrads) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hopefully, the young fan recognized the appreciative laugh from his victim.</p>‚Äî Stephen Barr (@CornfedCre8ive) <a href=#>January 31, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>They teach them early out in Philthydelphia.</p>‚Äî RBN (@RafaelBNunez) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></figure><p>Philly fans also heckled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joey Bosa</a> first before the game and then during the game.
