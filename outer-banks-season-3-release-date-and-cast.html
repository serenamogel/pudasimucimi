If that wasn’t enough of a shock, the season finale also saw Carla Limbray meet up with a wounded but very alive Big John. The two will be teaming up to find “the shroud” Limbray searched for throughout the season. The holy garment is rumored to have healing properties, and Big John claims he knows where it is.</p><p data-characters=670 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>In season three, Charles Halford will be playing John B.’s previously presumed dead father in a recurring role. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, the main cast will all be reprising their roles and newest Pogue Cleo, portrayed by Carlacia Grant, will be a main cast member in the new season. In addition to the returning cast members, Netflix has cast Andy McQueen as Carlos Singh, described as “a Caribbean don on a treasure hunt of his own,” and Lou Ferrigno, Jr. as Ryan, Singh’s top security officer. Season three will also see Fiona Palomo as Sofia, a self-identified Pogue who secretly longs to be a Kook and gets close to Rafe throughout the season.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false>The returning main cast consists of:</p><ul data-current-count=933 data-injectable=true><li>Chase Stokes as main protagonist John B.</li><li>Madelyn Cline as his love interest and “Kook princess” Sarah Cameron</li><li>Madison Bailey as Kiara “Kie” Carrera, the rebellious daughter of a wealthy restaurant owner</li><li>Jonathan Daviss as “the brains of the operation,” Pope Heyward</li><li>Rudy Pankow as John B.’s childhood friend, JJ Maybank</li><li>Austin North as Topper, Sarah’s ex-boyfriend and a well-known Kook</li><li>Charles Esten as Ward Cameron, a dangerous, wealthy businessman and Sarah’s father</li><li>Drew Starkey as Sarah’s troubled older brother, Rafe Cameron</li></ul><h2 id=h-when-will-outer-banks-season-three-release data-injectable=false>When will Outer Banks season three release?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Outer Banks (@obx)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Season three of Outer Banks will release on Feb. 23, 2023 on Netflix, and if the official trailer is anything to go by, it’s going to be the most heart-pounding season yet.
