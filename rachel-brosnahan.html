She made an even bigger impression when she starred as the ill-fated prostitute Rachel Posner on House of Cards between 2013-2015. However, her most famous role to date is playing dutiful Jewish wife-turned-comedienne Midge Maisel on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2018.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Parents</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born on July 12, 1990, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Brosnahan was the oldest child of three to a British mother and an American father who worked at a children's publishing company.

"She wanted to teach herself from the beginning. She did it all on her own, and we were really just in the background."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The budding actress attended Broadway bootcamp as a teen and graduated from Highland Park High School before finishing her education at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in 2012.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies and TV Shows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While in high school, Brosnahan made her film debut in Michael Bay's horror flick The Unborn (2009).

Concerning the latter project, Brosnahan later went on the record with The Hollywood Reporter saying she regrets working with the famed director due to the sexual allegations surrounding him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Honestly, it’s the decision that I have made in my life that is the most inconsistent with everything I stand for and believe in, both publicly and privately,” she said. “And while I can’t take it back, it’s important to me, moving forward, to make decisions that better reflect the things that I value and my worldview.”</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, it was when Brosnahan landed the titular role of Miriam "Midge" Maisel — a 1950s dutiful Jewish housewife who realizes she has a flair for comedy — on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, that Hollywood realized she was a forced to be reckoned with. Inspired by the lives of trailblazing comediennes <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/joan-rivers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joan Rivers" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Joan Rivers</a> and Totie Fields, the show was not only a hit for Amazon, but Brosnahan would also win a Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award for her work on the series.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"This is a story about a bold and brilliant and complicated woman, and I am so endlessly proud to be a part of it, but there are so many women's stories out there that still need and deserve to be told," the actress said during her acceptance speech at the 2018 Golden Globes.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Religion</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although there has been much public curiosity on whether Brosnahan is actually Jewish (she is not), she says she's very familiar with the culture. "I’ve spent more time in a temple than I ever have in a church," she told the Chicago Tribune, adding: "I spent so many Shabbat dinners with friends. I’ve probably been to 150 bar mitzvahs.”</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Nominations</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of her nominations and subsequent wins for Mrs. Maisel, Brosnahan was previously nominated for an Emmy for her supporting role as Rachel Posner in House of Cards, as well as a SAG Award for the show in the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series category.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2015, Brosnahan met actor Jason Ralph while the two were working on the television series Manhattan together.
