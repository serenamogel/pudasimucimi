Who Was Socrates?Socrates was a scholar, teacher and philosopher born in ancient Greece. His Socratic method laid the groundwork for Western systems of logic and philosophy. When the political climate of Greece turned against him, Socrates was sentenced to death by hemlock poisoning in 399 B.C. He accepted this judgment rather than fleeing into exile.
Early YearsBorn circa 470 B.C. in Athens, Greece, Socrates's life is chronicled through only a few sources: the dialogues of Plato and Xenophon and the plays of Aristophanes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, collectively, they provide a unique and vivid portrayal of Socrates's philosophy and personality.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Socrates was the son of Sophroniscus, an Athenian stonemason and sculptor, and Phaenarete, a midwife. Because he wasn't from a noble family, he probably received a basic Greek education and learned his father's craft at a young age. It's believed Socrates worked as mason for many years before he devoted his life to philosophy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Contemporaries differ in their account of how Socrates supported himself as a philosopher. Both Xenophon and Aristophanes state Socrates received payment for teaching, while Plato writes Socrates explicitly denied accepting payment, citing his poverty as proof.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Socrates married Xanthippe, a younger woman, who bore him three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus and Menexenus. There is little known about her except for Xenophon's characterization of Xanthippe as "undesirable."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He writes she was not happy with Socrates's second profession and complained that he wasn’t supporting family as a philosopher. By his own words, Socrates had little to do with his sons' upbringing and expressed far more interest in the intellectual development of Athens' other young boys.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Life in Athens</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Athenian law required all able-bodied males serve as citizen soldiers, on call for duty from ages 18 until 60. According to Plato, Socrates served in the armored infantry — known as the hoplite — with shield, long spear and face mask.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He participated in three military campaigns during the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/peloponnesian-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Peloponnesian War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Peloponnesian War</a>, at Delium, Amphipolis and Potidaea, where he saved the life of Alcibiades, a popular Athenian general.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Socrates was known for his fortitude in battle and his fearlessness, a trait that stayed with him throughout his life. After his trial, he compared his refusal to retreat from his legal troubles to a soldier's refusal to retreat from battle when threatened with death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Plato's Symposium provides the best details of Socrates' physical appearance. He was not the ideal of Athenian masculinity. Short and stocky, with a snub nose and bulging eyes, Socrates always seemed to appear to be staring.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, Plato pointed out that in the eyes of his students, Socrates possessed a different kind of attractiveness, not based on a physical ideal but on his brilliant debates and penetrating thought.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Socrates always emphasized the importance of the mind over the relative unimportance of the human body. This credo inspired Plato’s philosophy of dividing reality into two separate realms, the world of the senses and the world of ideas, declaring that the latter was the only important one.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Philosophy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Socrates believed that philosophy should achieve practical results for the greater well-being of society. He attempted to establish an ethical system based on human reason rather than theological doctrine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Socrates pointed out that human choice was motivated by the desire for happiness. Ultimate wisdom comes from knowing oneself. The more a person knows, the greater his or her ability to reason and make choices that will bring true happiness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Socrates believed that this translated into politics with the best form of government being neither a tyranny nor a democracy. Instead, government worked best when ruled by individuals who had the greatest ability, knowledge and virtue, and possessed a complete understanding of themselves.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,q_80/MTY2Nzk3MDk5ODgxNDc0MDI1/socrates_facts_desktop.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S SOCRATES FACT CARD" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S SOCRATES FACT CARD</a></strong></p><img alt="Socrates Fact Card" title="Socrates Fact Card" width=600 height=1437 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/socrates_facts_desktop.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Socratic Method</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For Socrates, Athens was a classroom and he went about asking questions of the elite and common man alike, seeking to arrive at political and ethical truths. Socrates didn’t lecture about what he knew. In fact, he claimed to be ignorant because he had no ideas, but wise because he recognized his own ignorance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He asked questions of his fellow Athenians in a dialectic method — the Socratic Method — which compelled the audience to think through a problem to a logical conclusion. Sometimes the answer seemed so obvious, it made Socrates' opponents look foolish. For this, his Socratic Method was admired by some and vilified by others.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During Socrates' life, Athens was going through a dramatic transition from hegemony in the classical world to its decline after a humiliating defeat by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Athenians entered a period of instability and doubt about their identity and place in the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a result, they clung to past glories, notions of wealth and a fixation on physical beauty. Socrates attacked these values with his insistent emphasis on the greater importance of the mind.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While many Athenians admired Socrates' challenges to Greek conventional wisdom and the humorous way he went about it, an equal number grew angry and felt he threatened their way of life and uncertain future.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Trial of Socrates</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 399 B.C., Socrates was accused of corrupting the youth of Athens and of impiety, or heresy. He chose to defend himself in court.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rather than present himself as wrongly accused, Socrates declared he fulfilled an important role as a gadfly, one who provides an important service to his community by continually questioning and challenging the status quo and its defenders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The jury was not swayed by Socrates' defense and convicted him by a vote of 280 to 221. Possibly the defiant tone of his defense contributed to the verdict and he made things worse during the deliberation over his punishment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Athenian law allowed a convicted citizen to propose an alternative punishment to the one called for by the prosecution and the jury would decide. Instead of proposing he be exiled, Socrates suggested he be honored by the city for his contribution to their enlightenment and be paid for his services.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The jury was not amused and sentenced him to death by drinking a mixture of poison hemlock.</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Socrates' Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Before Socrates' execution, friends offered to bribe the guards and rescue him so he could flee into exile.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He declined, stating he wasn't afraid of death, felt he would be no better off if in exile and said he was still a loyal citizen of Athens, willing to abide by its laws, even the ones that condemned him to death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Plato described Socrates' execution in his Phaedo dialogue: Socrates drank the hemlock mixture without hesitation. Numbness slowly crept into his body until it reached his heart. Shortly before his final breath, Socrates described his death as a release of the soul from the body.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scholars-educators/plato data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Plato class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Plato</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"],["</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scholars-educators/aristotle data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Aristotle class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Aristotle</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"]]" tml-render-layout="inline"></p><ul data-node-id=49 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Socrates</li><li>Birth Year: 470</li><li>Birth City: Athens</li><li>Birth Country: Greece</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher considered to be the main source of Western thought.
