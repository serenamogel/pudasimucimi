The couple first met and began secretly dating in 1990 when Pérez joined Selena’s band, Los Dinos, as the lead guitarist. The attraction between the pair was instant, but their love story was far from easy. The years before the singer's untimely death were filled with the two having to hide their relationship from her father and later eloping to finally be together.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Their first meeting came when Pérez joined the band</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Selena and Pérez first met in 1989 when Pérez was hired as the guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos. Pérez was instantly interested in Selena and the blossoming star made a lasting first impression on him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Beautiful and talented,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/selena-quintanillas-husband-chris-perez-remembers-the-first-time-he-laid-eyes-on-the-late-singer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Entertainment Tonight</a> of meeting his future wife. “I’m a shy person by nature, and there was just something about her that she was able to pull me out.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While the two quickly confessed their feelings for each other, Selena and Pérez decided to hide their relationship, knowing her father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, wouldn’t approve. However, the secrecy didn’t stop them from falling hard for each other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“We got to live a fast and crazy life as kids,” Pérez told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/selena-quintanillas-husband-chris-perez-remembers-the-first-time-he-laid-eyes-on-the-late-singer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ET class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">ET</a>. “I believe I was 20 when we first started getting serious with each other.”</p><img alt="Chris Perez Selena Quintanilla husband" title="Chris Perez Selena Quintanilla husband" width=1684 height=2548 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-50438908.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Barbara Laing/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images/Getty Images</span><p>Chris Pérez</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The couple eloped to force Selena's father to accept their relationship</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Chaos soon started when Selena’s sister, Suzette, told their father about the relationship. Abraham confronted the guitarist and even kicked him off the tour bus, though the two would go on to continue their love in secret.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Abraham later confronted the two and fired Pérez from the band in retaliation, even <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wkyc.com/article/entertainment/remembering-selena-chris-perez-on-his-book-to-selena-with-love/273-413442959 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="calling him" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">calling him</a> a “cancer” to the family, according to Pérez.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It kind of hurt his pride and his ego to find out that he was the last to know,” Pérez explained in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wkyc.com/article/entertainment/remembering-selena-chris-perez-on-his-book-to-selena-with-love/273-413442959 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">CNN</a> in 2012. “When things got tense and things were said by him, it hurt me that he was saying it, but I didn't let it get to me because I knew deep down, he knew the kind of person I was.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On April 2, 1992, Selena and Pérez came up with a plan to elope in order to force Abraham to accept their love. Pérez later remembered the day <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.facebook.com/ChrisPerezMusic/photos/a.200358669996607/1515807505118377/?type=3" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="in a Facebook post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">in a Facebook post</a> celebrating their 25th anniversary in 2019. The musician also shared a picture of their marriage certificate from Nueces County, Texas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It's hard to believe that today marks 25 years since Selena and I decided that the only way to be together...was to run away and get married (at 20 and 22 years old) in secret. What a rollercoaster ride THAT day was,” Pérez <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.facebook.com/ChrisPerezMusic/photos/a.200358669996607/1515807505118377/?type=3" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=wrote class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wrote</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">They had to learn how to navigate marriage and their careers at the same time</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The couple's risk paid off. Abraham accepted the two after their elopement and welcomed Pérez back into the band. Now the two faced starting their life as a married couple while also spending all their time working together, and Pérez admitted that the pressure led to them considering getting divorced.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I think what it boiled down to is that we were young,” he said to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wkyc.com/article/entertainment/remembering-selena-chris-perez-on-his-book-to-selena-with-love/273-413442959 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">CNN</a>. “We were married and together 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to learn how to handle that and that was both of us. It’s not like she brought up the idea and I was fighting it because honestly, I was right there with her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, through lots of communication, the two decided to keep their love going.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The more we talked about it and the more time went on, it wasn’t a long time, maybe a month, we ended up patching things up and making a promise that we would never let that happen again,” Pérez said.</p><img alt="Selena Quintanilla family Chris Perez funeral" title="Selena Quintanilla family Chris Perez funeral" width=3072 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-50606432.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Barbara Laing/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images/Getty Images</span><p>Selena’s mother Marcela Quintanilla, (2L), husband Chris Pérez (3L) and sister Suzette (2R) laying roses atop the casket at her funeral in 1995.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Selena and Pérez's love story was cut tragically short</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On March 31, 1995, just three days before the couple could celebrate their third wedding anniversary, Selena was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldivar, her fan club president and the manager of Selena’s boutiques.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Days earlier, Selena, Pérez and Abraham had confronted Saldivar about embezzling over $30,000 from the boutiques and fan club, demanding paperwork that would prove her innocence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The morning of her death, Selena left Pérez sleeping at home and headed to a motel where Saldivar had requested they meet to hand over the documents. The two argued at the motel in Corpus Christi until Saldivar pulled out a gun and pointed it at Selena, shooting her in the shoulder when the singer tried to flee.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Selena was later pronounced dead from blood loss and cardiac arrest during emergency surgery at Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Pérez helps keeps her legacy alive</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Decades after her tragic death, Selena remains a force in the music industry and widely remembered by friends. Just like her millions of fans, Pérez has continued to work with the Quintanilla family to keep Selena’s legacy alive. So much so that the musician still feels her presence with him every day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Abraham said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.etonline.com/news/213379_exclusive_selena_turns_20_her_family_reflects_on_the_movie_and_her_legacy_in_my_mind_she_still_alive data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2017 interview" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">2017 interview</a> that he forgets “that she’s not here with us anymore,” and Pérez said he feels the same way.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I understand what he means,” Pérez told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.etonline.com/selena-quintanillas-husband-chris-perez-remembers-the-first-time-he-laid-eyes-on-the-late-singer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ET class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">ET</a>. “There are times where it feels like you can pick up the phone and call her.
