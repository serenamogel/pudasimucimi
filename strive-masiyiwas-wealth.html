He is best known as the founder and chairman of Econet Wireless, a diversified telecommunications group. Masiyiwa has received numerous accolades for his business acumen and philanthropy, being recognized as one of the most generous humanitarians. He has been involved in business since 1993.</p><p>According to reliable sources, Strive Masiyiwa’s net worth is estimated to be $280 million, as of mid-2017. His primary source of wealth is Econet Wireless.</p><h3>Strive Masiyiwa’s Net Worth Reaches $280 Million</h3><p>He spent his early years in Zimbabwe and received his primary education in Zambia before completing high school in Scotland. Later, he pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wales, following which he briefly worked as a telecommunication engineer before venturing into entrepreneurship.</p><p>In 1993, he established the private company Econet Wireless in Zimbabwe. However, it took five years to obtain a telephony license due to the fact that in 1998, the majority of Zimbabwe’s residents had never used a telephone. Acquiring the license required a five-year legal battle that ultimately ended in favor of Masiyiwa. Consequently, in 1998, he was recognized as one of the top 10 young leaders worldwide by the World Junior Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>In 2000, Masiyiwa left Zimbabwe to expand his company and temporarily settled in South Africa. By 2014, the company had expanded its operations by acquiring Telecel in the Central African Republic and Burundi. Additionally, the company holds a UK license and operates there as Econet Satellite Services. Overall, the company offers fixed telephony and mobile telephony, satellite, broadband, and mobile payment services in South America, Europe, and Africa.</p><p>In 2014, Strive was named one of the 50 most influential business leaders globally by Fortune Magazine. The following year, Forbes listed him as one of the 10 Most Powerful Men in Africa. In 2015, he was bestowed with the Freedom Award by the International Rescue Committee. Recently, he was named in Fortune Magazine’s list of the World’s Greatest Leaders 2017.</p><p>In terms of philanthropy, Strive Masiyiwa is known for being the most active African-born supporter. Through various foundations and programs, he has provided education for over 40,000 African children. He has also initiated several programs to combat cancer, Ebola, and HIV/AIDS, in addition to investing over $15 million in African agriculture.</p><p>On the personal front, Strive Masiyiwa is married to Tsitsi Masiyiwa. The couple has six children and currently resides in London, England.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$280 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1961-01-29</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Zimbabwe</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Businessman, CEO, Founder of Econet Wireless</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Wales</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Zimbabwean</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Tsitsi Masiyiwa</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/strivemasiyiwa</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/strivemasiyiwa</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/strivemasiyiwa</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Freedom Award by International Rescue Committee (2015)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>World’s Greatest Leaders (2017, Fortune magazine), 10 Most Powerful Men in Africa (2015, Forbes), United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Committee on Conscience, 50 most influential business leaders in the world (2014, Fortune magazine)</td></tr></tbody></table><br><i class=mdi-book-open-outline></i> Posted in <a href=# rel="category tag">Scoop</a> <a href=# rel=prev><span><i class=mdi-chevron-left></i>Prev</span>EFCC grills actress over spraying and stepping on new Naira notes</a> <a href=# rel=next><span>Next<i class=mdi-chevron-right></i></span>About Lizz Winstead’s Net Worth</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiqraqZq7JuucCsoLKhp5bAbsPEmqOtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
