Despite that, it seems AEW Rampage truly does have a big problem garnering ratings and a proper audience.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer stated that&nbsp;“lots and lots” of fans left during the latest AEW Rampage taping in Boston, Massachusetts. It was said that after the Bryan Danielson vs Eddie Kingston match, fans simply just left the arena.</p><p>“Next was Dante Martin against Matt Sydal. The match was good – one of the things though is the crowd chanted, they were doing a lot of wrestling and they were doing less acrobatics than in their previous matches, and the crowd was chanting, ‘We want flips’, so they were not appreciative of the mat work.</p><p>“Also I’m gonna say this, and this is not a social experiment but it is a social experiment at the same time. Lots and lots of people left after the Eddie Kingston/Bryan Danielson match. Many, many, many, many people. That absolutely happened, just like at the show we mentioned before with Alexa Bliss and Charlotte Flair. It absolutely happened. So I can get all this hate mail, or I won’t, because it happened.”</p><p>Tony Khan believes everything is under control regarding AEW Rampage. However, others do not feel that is the case as AEW Rampage’s ratings continue to drop every week. Fans leaving the arena after the first match certainly does not help matters either, so we certainly wonder what the company will do to remedy its situation.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
