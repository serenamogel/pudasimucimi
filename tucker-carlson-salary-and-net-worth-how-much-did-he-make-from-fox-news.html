Recommended Videos Before he became known as Fox News’ lackey and a corrupt, conspiracy-theorizing journalist of the poorest integrity, Tucker Carlson worked at CNN and MSNBC for nearly a decade in the nearly 2000s. In 2009, he transferred over to Fox, and that is where he stayed until April 24, 2023, when he was ultimately — and abruptly — shown the door."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Despite talking out of both sides of his mouth (the man <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to despising</a> Donald Trump off-air), Carlson’s specific brand of right-wing conspiracy earned him a loyal fan base and a pretty penny.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=#>Yahoo! Finance</a>, the 53-year-old news host brought in $8 million per year at Fox, making him fifth among the list of richest cable news hosts. In first place is his former colleague, Sean Hannity, with a whopping $25 million per year salary.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-tucker-carlson-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>What is Tucker Carlson’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tucker-carlson.jpg><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Sure, there are other cable news hosts with larger salaries than Carlson’s, but being a cable news host isn’t the man’s only source of income, and not just because he was fired. In 2020, he co-founded The Daily Caller, a far-right opinion-based news outlet&nbsp;with political advisor, Neil Patel.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Thanks to The Daily Caller and his years of devoted service to journalistic dishonesty — let’s not forget his lies about the 2020 election and Dominion Voting System, which contributed to Fox News’ $787.5 million settlement with the voting company — Carlson’s net worth is around $30 million, according to Yahoo! Finance.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>That’s $30 million with a big three-oh; for spreading lies, hate, and talking out of both sides of his mouth.
