As The Ex Actor Was Being Arrested</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-06</div><p><strong>Many are curious about the arrest of Adam Hicks, who starred in Lemonade Mouth. The former actor is suddenly famous, but for all the wrong reasons. Adam Hicks is a former actor who has acted in numerous films, including Pair of Kings, Zeke and Luther, and Lemonade Mouth.</strong></p><p>Following his appearances in multiple Disney programs and films, the actor rose to stardom for all the right reasons.</p><p>Yet, Hicks is well-known for all the wrong reasons, as he has spent his whole life on parole following a conviction for robbery. Thus, why was Hick detained? Let us research.</p><h2>Adam Hicks was detained on suspicion of armed robbery</h2><p>Adam Hicks, a former child actor, was arrested in Burbank, California in 2018 for second-degree armed robbery. After perpetrating many armed robberies, Hicks was captured.</p><p>Likewise, he was sentenced to five years in prison in July 2021. Moreover, cops arrested Hicks and his girlfriend, Danni Tamburo, when they sped through a Burbank neighborhood brandishing a firearm.</p><p>Also, they attempted to aggressively seize cash, mobile phones, and other valuables. For committing such a horrific murder, Hick was sentenced to five years in prison, while his accomplice received three years of probation.</p><p>In addition, the actor had a reputation for harshness prior to his arrest. Hick had previously wounded himself in the leg. It is unclear what motivated his idiotic behavior, but he did it while out with friends.</p><p>Also, officials said that Hick was uncooperative with law enforcement. Similarly, the cops apprehended the former Disney actor after his partner reported his abusive behavior.</p><p>Hicks pulled Danni’s hair, seized her arms, and shoved her to the floor. The only reason why Hicks was not indicted was that Fanni refused to assist the police despite his violent behavior.</p><h2>Is the actor Lemonade Mouth incarcerated or free?</h2><p>In March 2022, Adam Hicks, a Disney star, will make his debut. Likewise, Hicks is free on bond after serving a five-year sentence for robbery.</p><p>When the court awarded him roughly 1,460 days of credit, his case made substantial progress. Hicks was awaiting his punishment while serving prison.</p><p>Hicks was additionally charged with five counts, including three counts of attempted robbery and two counts of theft. Only three charges were heard, and in January 2021, the two attempted counts were dismissed. He is still on parole after being released in March of this year.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
