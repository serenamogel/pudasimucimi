The horror studio confirmed that Five Nights at Freddy’s will not only hit theaters later this week, but it will also be premiering via streaming service Peacock. Before the full-length feature officially arrives just in time for the spooky season, let’s examine where exactly folks can stream the spine-tingling project.</p><h2 id=h-where-can-i-stream-five-nights-at-freddy-s data-injectable=false>Where can I stream Five Nights at Freddy’s?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>The film adaptation of&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;will have a somewhat similar plot to the video games, as perfectly depicted throughout the film’s eye-popping trailer above. Visual effects company Jim Henson’s Creature Shop is also involved in this horror project, creating the animatronics that will be featured throughout the film, which present an aesthetically-pleasing sort of vibe.</p><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>Fortunately, filming for this upcoming film ended around April 3. According to the official announcement made by Blumhouse,&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;will be available to stream on Peacock the same day as the film’s theatrical release. Unfortunately for international viewers, Peacock is only available to U.S. viewers and there was no news about bringing the film to other streaming services. This means that the only option for those outside of the U.S. is to see it in theaters. Either that or viewers can wait patiently to see if the movie hits more streaming services in the future.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>For those interested in viewing the animatronic chaos, be sure to flock to theaters or fire up Peacock on your TV Friday, Oct. 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdopp6pK3NZqBmq6SnsqK5jK2fnmWWnsOmec2inqGso2KutXnFq5ydnKmoeq671aKcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
