He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can’t keep a straight face while shooting the show</a>, and neither can we. But unlike what you may think, even if David uses his own name for the semi-fictionalized character, no, he is not married to Cheryl — and he never was.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>In fact, the actor only recently tied the knot for the second time, and in case you’ve been wondering who managed to change all of Larry’s perspectives on love, here’s everything about Ashley Underwood.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-ashley-underwood-larry-david-s-wife data-injectable=false>Who is Ashley Underwood, Larry David’s wife?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Larry-David-Ashley-Underwood.jpg><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true>David finally found himself a “prett-ay, prett-ay, prett-ay good,” deal when he met Underwood. According to the comedian for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>, Underwood and David met in 2017 while at Sacha Baron Cohen’s birthday party, because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">of course they also had to have the best meeting story of all time</a>. The duo sat beside each other at the event, and it appears that from then on out, it all became history.</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>With his relentless resentment towards love and dating torn apart, in 2019 Underwood and her cat moved in with David and his daughter. The actor admittedly confessed that the arrangement wasn’t easy, and that “there’s not a moment in the day when there isn’t friction between at least two of us.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by VandyPop 🍿 🎬 🎟 🎶 📺 (@vandypop)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Knowing that being married to Larry David – who appears to be both the most complicated and simplest man in Hollywood — would not be easy, the couple made it work. In 2020, they finally officiated their relationship in Southern California. But here’s the true kicker: Who really is Underwood?</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Well, unsurprisingly, Underwood is also connected to the entertainment industry. In fact, she was the producer of Baron Cohen’s Who is America?. She is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> around 44 years old, meaning she is 38 years younger than David. Regardless of their age gap, the duo appears to get along brilliantly, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she admits to appreciating</a> and emulating his sense of humor.</p><p>“We’ll be at a dinner party, and Larry will take his last bit of food and just stand up for us to go. I just shrug. He gets the laugh, and I get to ride his coattails.”</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=false>Overall, the duo has managed to create a long-lasting and tight relationship, away from the limelight and the cameras – a feat in and of itself, if I do say so myself. In the meantime, Curb You Enthusiasm is available on MAX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmpJGnv7p5w5qtopxdoq6zvsiem2asn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
