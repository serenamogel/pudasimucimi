Given every action Ghost took in trying to live a legit life, keep his family together, and distance himself from his old dangerous ways, why were his days still numbered? And why did Tariq, Ghost’s own son, kill his father?</p><h2 id=h-the-strained-relationship-between-father-and-son data-injectable=false>The strained relationship between father and son</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>After getting out of prison, Ghost was determined to fly straight and run a legitimate business operation after a dangerous and consequential life of crime. While he was away, though, the lives of his loved ones hung in the balance, and after his release, it was imperative for Ghost to keep his family together, while staying out of trouble. With the cast of characters in this show, that was definitely no easy task.</p><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Tariq spent the first two seasons of the story arc deeply loyal to his family unit finally made complete upon Ghost’s return from incarceration. Eventually, though, Ghost’s seemingly traitorous break from the family during the show’s third season practically causes Tariq’s personality to do an about-face. Tariq gets more acclimated to the environment that once compromised Ghost; this is a demonstration of Tariq’s resentment of his father and a form of acting out towards him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>In the fourth season, Tariq’s turn for the worse was nearly complete. He had been involved in robberies and additional tests of fortitude that were orchestrated by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanan</a>, a rival of Ghost. He endured a kidnapping, death threats, heavy treachery, and the loss of people close to him, all of which further fueled his disdain for his father.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>And in the fifth season, Tariq openly showed favoritism toward Kanan over his whole family. He then got fully immersed in the drug game, becoming a seller at his own school.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>The sixth and final season of the series featured Tariq’s expulsion from school as a result of his drug activities, but more seriously, his life was threatened again, and he was disavowed by Tommy, Ghost’s close confidant. And after his once-secretive activities came to light, he was faced with picking between what was legit, and the underworld that everyone else in his circle seemed to have a hand in.</p><h2 id=h-tariq-makes-the-biggest-decision-of-his-life-thus-far data-injectable=false>Tariq makes the biggest decision of his life, thus far</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>Inevitably, Tariq seemed to become familiar with the world that his father, Ghost, strove to distance his whole family from. And because of his father’s independent actions, Tariq saw plenty of reasons to start making some important decisions of his own.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>However, Ghost himself confronted his son with his strong disappointment that Tariq chose the life of a criminal. He even laid out the consequences for Tariq, should he ever betray his father again. That was all Tariq needed to fully realize he was no longer living under Ghost’s wing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Tariq made the decision — along with a spiritual nudge by the late Kanan — to do away with his father. He confronts him with the belief that it was Ghost’s actions that broke their family apart and that the damage is irreversible. Tariq shoots Ghost who, as he slowly dies, directs Tommy not to kill Tariq in response to his impending death.</p><h2 id=h-where-is-tariq-now-in-the-power-universe data-injectable=false>Where is Tariq now in the Power universe?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=false>Tariq’s mother, Tasha, takes the fall for Ghost’s murder, allowing Tariq to finish high school and make his way to college.
