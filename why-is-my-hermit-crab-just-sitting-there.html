Lethargy can also be a sign of stress. Recognize that most hermit crabs like to play and will move around their habitats a lot if they are not molting or sick. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on wikihow.com</a><h2>Why is my hermit crab staying in one place?</h2>Re: crab stays in one place, never digs<p>As for activity; hermit crabs are nocturnal and generally don't do much during the day.

What Do I Do? || Naked Hermit Crab Help</h2><h2>Is my crab dead or molting?</h2>Molts don't smell like roses, though some might diplomatically call their scent “beachy,” but dead crabs are downright foul – an odor you don't easily forget.

If you can't smell anything, pick the crab out of the tank to get a closer whiff. If you smell a salty, rotten scent, there's a good chance that your crab has passed away. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What do hermit crabs do before they molt?</h2>Eating and drinking more than usual for a bit before the molt could be an indicator as molting hermit crabs first store up a lot of fat and water and gorge like crazy.

Hermit crabs require humidity of around 50-70%. They need this to keep their gills moist and to breathe properly. If the air is too dry, your hermit crab might become inactive and suffocate. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on petsdomain.com.au</a><h2>Do hermit crabs stop moving when they molt?</h2>Molting is the process by which a hermit crab grows. It involves shedding of the exoskeleton and for a short time afterward the crab is unable to move until it regains muscle control and the new exoskeleton hardens up. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on hermitcrabpatch.com</a><h2>Why is my hermit crab not very active?</h2>Some crabs get slow and cranky, others are busy, some load up on food, others increase their water intake.

Molting crabs usually stay buried under the substrate and do not emit any odor. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on justanswer.com</a><h2>What happens if you disturb a molting hermit crab?</h2>You may need to remove other hermits while they are molting so they are not disturbed. If you disturb them they could fall apart as they are very soft. Their new extremities could fall off leaving them without a feeder claw for a whole cycle. Usually they do not survive this if they are disturbed. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on seashellshop.com</a><h2>What kills hermit crabs?</h2>Fish such as pricklebacks, gunnels, clingfish and snailfish prey on hermit crabs, as do sea stars, larger crabs, gulls and crows. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on seattleaquarium.org</a><h2>Are hermit crabs hard to keep alive?</h2>No but they do require very specific care and you need to have at min 3 living together and they need space to forage and move around. They also seem to benefit from having their enclosures setup changed around a few times a year.
